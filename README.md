# smart_train_dispatching
Smart Train Dispatching project MVP using Excel VBA connected to Oracle DB. For demonstration purposes.

This repo is created for demonstrating the Smart Train Dispatching project.

**Description of the project**
Smart Train Dispatching System is developed for one the world’s largest iron mines’ internal rail network

- The system leverages real-time train positioning data together with data about excavators, production plans etc. to predict possible bottlenecks and advises human dispatchers on optimal train distribution to reduce unproductive train time
  
- Prediction model is built based on statistical analysis of 2 years’ worth of data on train movements

- A fully functional MVP with a user interface was developed, tested, and implemented. $2 million savings behind optimization confirmed

- Used technologies: Visual Basic for Applications, Oracle DB, Java
